# Step 3: Implement Changes

## Task

Execute the refactoring plan from the previous step.

### Guidelines

1. **Make changes incrementally**
   - One file at a time
   - One logical change at a time

2. **Preserve behavior**
   - Don't change functionality
   - Keep public API compatible (if applicable)

3. **Update imports/references**
   - Fix all broken references
   - Update all callers

4. **Maintain code style**
   - Follow existing conventions
   - Don't reformat unrelated code

## Implementation

Make the planned changes now. For each change:
1. State what you're changing
2. Make the edit
3. Confirm the change was successful

## Output

- List of completed changes
- Any unexpected issues encountered
